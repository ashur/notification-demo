> An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (_Malus domestica_). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus _Malus_. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, _Malus sieversii_, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists.
