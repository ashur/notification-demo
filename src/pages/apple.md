title: Apple
---

An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition. 

## Etymology

The word apple, formerly spelled Ã¦ppel in Old English, is derived from the Proto-Germanic root _ap(a)laz_, which could also mean fruit in general. This is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European _ab(e)l-_, but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both words is uncertain.
